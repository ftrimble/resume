\hfill \emph{July 2014 - Present}

\noindent \emph{Text Recognition experience for Firefly}
\begin{compactitemize}
\item Participated in a hack-day project for business card recognition
  that was successful enough to spur the creation of a new team to pursue
  the project more seriously.
\item Delivered recognition algorithms for four new word types,
  doubling the available types.
\item Implemented a positional homography between images based on a
  linear regression of text positions, and prototyped an algorithm
  that would take a set of free-form text zones and the homography to
  produce greatest-confidence zones over the body of text.
\end{compactitemize}

\noindent \emph{Build infrastructure improvements}
\begin{compactitemize}
\item Independently recognized the need for a state caching
  system for our build tools and designed and implemented a suite of
  bash scripts to do so, outside of my sprint deliverables. This
  reduced build times by as much as 10x, causing massive increases in
  developer productivity.
\item Drove improvements in quality standards, driving the adoption of
  static analysis tools and maintaining the statistically highest code
  review standards on my team.
\item Migrated a set of over 30 packages from ANT to Gradle, bringing
  our build infrastructure up to date with the latest Android technology.
\item Contributed multi-module build functionality to company-wide
  gradle add-ons, allowing teams across Amazon to produce Android apks
  that are tested by multiple instrumentation apks.
\end{compactitemize}

\noindent \emph{Prototype device efforts}
\begin{compactitemize}
\item Architected an extensible framework for displaying textual
  information to the user with a given priority, timeout behavior, and
  display behavior that hooks into our pipeline of events to broadcast
  updates.
\item Created a robust camera stack that utilizes RxJava to send
  events when a camera frame meets requirements. This stack needed to
  cope with some implementation issues of incomplete support from our
  hardware vendor, which I resolved by creating a mapping
  between two asynchronous streams of data using a custom data
  structure that automatically closes items when they cannot be
  matched within a given time frame.
\end{compactitemize}

\noindent {\bf Software Development Engineer Intern - Firefly}
\hfill \emph{May - August 2013}

\begin{compactitemize}
\item Architected a classification and extraction service for a new
  word type through our existing text recognition infrastructure. This
  word type was the first to span multiple lines of text.
\item Multiline classification was wrought with problems due to
  failures in the underlying zoning algorithms. I simplified the whole
  approach by breaking down classification into multiple single-line
  procedures and an extraction method that could span multiple zones
  of unclassified text.

\noindent {\bf Creator/Developer - King Me} \hfill \emph{September
  2013 - May 2014}

\begin{compactitemize}
\item Ideated and implemented an algorithm for generating a bicycle
  route with a given starting point that is approximately a given
  distance.
\item Coordinated 5 developers to deliver a web interface and an Android
  application, driving feature requests and prioritizations.

\begin{compactitemize}
\item Worked in a team of 4 developers to deliver a suite of linux

\item Delivered a simple GUI and a parser for the mkvsynth DSL.
